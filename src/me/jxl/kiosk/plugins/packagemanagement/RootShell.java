/**
 * Root command execution over a single long-lived {@code su} shell rather
 * than a fresh process per command.
 *
 * <h2>Why persistent</h2>
 *
 * This plugin samples every 10 seconds and each tick used to spawn two
 * {@code su} processes (renderer sampling, then {@code top}). Magisk shows
 * its "granted Superuser rights" toast per <em>request</em>, so that was
 * twelve grants a minute from this plugin alone — enough that Android
 * started dropping the toasts for exceeding its quota, which is how the
 * problem was noticed. Process spawning also is not free on the low-end
 * panels this plugin exists to measure, and measuring a panel should not
 * be a meaningful part of that panel's load.
 *
 * One shell means one grant per plugin start, and per-command cost drops
 * to writing a line and reading the reply.
 *
 * <h2>How a command is framed</h2>
 *
 * Commands go to the shell's stdin; there is no separate process to wait
 * on and therefore no exit status to read. Instead each command is
 * followed by {@code echo <token>:$?}, and output is read until that token
 * appears. The token is generated per session, so command output cannot
 * plausibly contain it. A multi-line script reports its last command's
 * status, exactly as {@code su -c script} did.
 *
 * <h2>What happens when it goes wrong</h2>
 *
 * A command that exceeds its timeout leaves the shell with unread output
 * still to come, and there is no reliable way to tell that output from the
 * next command's. Resynchronising is guesswork, so the session is killed
 * instead and the next call starts a clean one. Same for EOF (the shell
 * died, or root was revoked). Failures are therefore never silent
 * corruption; they cost one extra grant.
 *
 * <h2>On holding root open</h2>
 *
 * A long-lived root shell is a deliberate posture change from transient
 * ones: the privilege is identical, but it stays available for the
 * plugin's lifetime rather than for the moment a command runs. It ends
 * with the plugin — {@link #shutdown()} is called from the plugin's stop
 * path — so disabling the plugin closes it. ha-paneld makes the same
 * trade with its root helper daemon.
